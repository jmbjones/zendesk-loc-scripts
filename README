## Zendesk Loc Scripts

See the following article on the Zendesk website to use the scripts in the **initial_handoff_wp** folder:

- [Automating your first localization handoff (Web portal)](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/51237108)

The scripts are based on custom automation scripts the docs team at Zendesk uses to localize the [Zendesk documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/categories/12128). Please note that the scripts aren't official Zendesk features and aren't supported.
