The following articles on the Zendesk website explains how to use the scripts in the folders:

Automating your first localization handoff (Help Center)
- url: https://support.zendesk.com/entries/53090153 (for beta participants only)
- scripts: "hc_initial_handoff" folder

Note: The APIs used in the Help Center scripts are currently in beta. You must sign up for the beta to use the APIs and view the article. Visit https://zendesk.wufoo.com/forms/help-center-api-beta-sign-up.

The scripts are based on custom automation scripts the docs team at Zendesk uses to localize the Zendesk documentation. The scripts are provided as a contribution to the community. They aren't part of the Zendesk product and aren't supported.
